          <h2>Artist & Designer</h2>
          <p>I am a Textile and Graphic Designer. My journey into the design world officially began in 2020 when I
            studied Textile Design,
            which led my transition into Graphic Design.
            After my enrollment in the Graphic Design program at Humber, I have become familiar with HTML and CSS while
            working on a few webiste projects.
            Additionally, I have worked on various tasks for print and web such as animation, poster design, photo
            editing and illustrations.
